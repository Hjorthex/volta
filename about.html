            Although electric cars still have their big breakthrough for good,
            they are slowly gaining more and more traction on the roads. But the
            challenge of getting the cars to run far enough on a single charge,
            and being able to charge the battery fast enough, still holds many
            back from throwing themselves into an electric car adventure. To
            solve that problem, we, Volta, will now explore the possibility of
            developing roads that charge the cars while they drive, using
            induction technology. Initially, the technology will be tested in a
            closed area over a period of 18 months. If it turns out to be a
            success, one will subsequently test the technology on the right
            track.
